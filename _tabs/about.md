## Hello!

My name is **Zakarye Ridoine**, and here’s a little about me:
- I’m a second-year student pursuing an associate degree in Systems and Networks in Morocco.
- I’m deeply passionate about technology, especially the fields of networking and cybersecurity.
- My primary focus is offensive security, where I enjoy learning about ethical hacking and penetration testing.
- When I’m not studying, I spend my time exploring cybersecurity tools, solving CTF challenges, and improving my skills.
- Through this blog, I aim to share simple and practical articles about networking and cybersecurity to help others learn and grow.

Feel free to follow along and join me on this journey!
